# Namespace: Organizations

An Organization is a high-level container within Verdocs that groups together Templates, Documents, Profiles, Billing, and
other settings. A User may be a member of more than one Organization. Each membership is tracked by a Profile representing
that user's settings within that organization. It is important to select the correct Profile before performing operations
against the Verdocs API, as this also sets the Organization that will be operated on, and the user's permissions within it.
